## Full Description (4,000 char max)

Portwood DocGen is a completely free, 100% native document generation app for Salesforce. Generate professional PDFs and Word documents from any standard or custom object using familiar Word templates with simple merge tags. No external servers, no callouts, no per-user fees — your data never leaves your Salesforce org.

**How it works:** Design your template in Microsoft Word. Add merge tags like {Name}, {Account.Name}, or {#Contacts}{FirstName}{/Contacts}. Upload the template, click Generate from any record page — done. DocGen handles the rest.

**What sets DocGen apart:**

- Every feature is free. No paid tiers, no per-user pricing, no feature gating. Every user in your org gets full access to everything — forever.

- 100% native to Salesforce. Zero external dependencies. No data leaves your org. No external API calls. Works even when third-party services are down. Respects all sharing rules, CRUD, and field-level security.

- Point-and-click setup. The visual query builder lets admins pick fields, parent lookups, and child record relationships without writing code. Works with any standard or custom object.

- Handles massive documents. The Giant Query engine generates documents from records with 50,000+ child records — invoices with thousands of line items, audit trails, transaction logs, price books. Auto-detects large datasets. Same template, same button.
